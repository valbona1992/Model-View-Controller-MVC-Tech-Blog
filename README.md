# Model-View-Controller-MVC-Tech-Blog

Build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

To run locally, use MYSQL to create the database from the schema folder, and from the command line, run `npm run seed`. Afterwards, run `node server.js`. Once the server is started,the app can open at localhost:3001 in a browser of choice.

Insomnia will be used to test routes on on http//:localhost:3001/.
